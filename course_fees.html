      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>Learn to build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
WEB
Is a system of interlinked hypertext document and multimedia accessed via the internet  using web browsers.
The web uses the HTTP/HTTPS protocols to transmit data, enabling users to view web pages, images, videos and other resourcesTYPES OF WEBSITE.
There are different types of  websites these are;
1.static websites
‚Ä¢	It display fixed content usually written in HTML.
‚Ä¢	Content does not change unless manually updated by developer.
‚Ä¢	Ideal for small sites or portfolios.

2.Dynamic websites 
‚Ä¢	Content is generated in real-time based on user interaction or database queries .
Often use server ‚Äìside scripting languages like PHP or Javascript frame works.
‚Ä¢	Suitable for larger application, e-commerce sites and blogs.

3.E-commerce websites
‚Ä¢	This facilitates online buying and selling of products /services.
‚Ä¢	Feature shopping carts , payment gateways and user accounts.


4.Blogs 
‚Ä¢	Platforms for sharing articles or personal thoughts.
‚Ä¢	Content is regularly updated and often allows for user comments.


5.Portifolio  websites
‚Ä¢	It showcase an individual‚Äôs or company‚Äôs work.
‚Ä¢	Common among artist ,designers and freelancers.



6.Social Media Websites
ÔÉò	It enable users to create and share content  or connect with others.
ÔÉò	Examples include Facebook, Twitter and I nstagram.



WEB PAGE ADDRESSES(URLs)
A uniform Resource Locator(URLs) ;is the address used to access resources on the web.
It consist of several components ;
ÔÉò	Protocol; it specify the method of data transfer example HTTP,HTTPS 
ÔÉò	Domain name; the human readable address of the web site example WWW.example .com.
ÔÉò	Path; the specific location of the resource on the server example /folder/page. HTML 
ÔÉò	Query parameters; Optional data sent to the server example ?id=123,often used in dynamic pages to filter or sort content
Web page addresses can be typed into a web browser‚Äôs address bar to assess the corresponding website or page.



                       WEB BROWSER, WEB SERVERS AND DOMAIN NAME SERVERS (DNS)
WEB BROWSER; Is a software application that retrieves and display web content . Popular browser include chrome, firefox and safari. They interpret HTML, CSS and java script to render webpage visually.


WEB SERVER;  A system that host website and deliver webpage to user browser. It processes incoming request, retrieves the request resources and sends them back to the client example include apache, and Nginx.



DOMAIN NAME SERVER (DNS); A network service that translate human readable domain names into IP address allowing browser to locate webservers. When you enter a   URLs, DNS resolve the domain to an IP address so the browser can connect to the server.
DNS servers help users access website by directing their browser to collect webserver hosting the desired website.

      <h3>computer Made Easy</h3>
      <p>Understand core computer concepts and solve real-world problems
CONCEPT OF MEMORY MANAGEMENT
Memory management is a crucial aspect of an operating system that involve managing and organizing the system‚Äôs memory resources.
It is responsible for allocating memory to different processes, ensuring that each process has sufficient
Memory to execute   and preventing one process from accessing or overwriting another process‚Äôs memory space.
Memory management in an operating system includes various techniques such as memory  allocation, memory protection, memory mapping and memory swapping.
These techniques help to optimize the use of available memory resources and ensure efficient and reliable operation of the system.
Memory management in operating system is like a conductor of an orchestra , making sure that  each program gets the memory it needs to run smoothly .It involve allocating and deallocating memory space ,protecting memory from unauthorized access, and swapping data between RAM and storage.

Effective memory management is essential for maximizing system performance , preventing memory-related errors and crashes and ensuring the stability and security of the operating system.
The main aim of memory management is to achieve efficient utilization of memory.
Why memory management is required?
ÔÉº	To minimize fragmentation issues.
ÔÉº	To maintain data integrity while executing of process.
ÔÉº	To keep track of used memory space by processes.
ÔÉº	Allocating and deallocating memory before  and after process executing.

      <h3>OPERATING SYSTEM</h3>
      <p>PAGING 
Is a memory management techniques where operating system divides both physical memory and logical memory into fixed size blocks called frames and pages , respectively.

The process of retrieving processes in form of pages from the secondary storage into main memory is known as paging.
It allows for non-contiguous allocation meaning a process‚Äôs pages can be scattered through the physical memory, improving memory utilization and reducing fragmentation.
A page table is used to map virtual addresses to physical addresses.
The page table  maps each logical page number to a physical page frame number .By using  page table  the operating system keeps tracks of the mapping between logical addresses and physical addresses.
The basic purpose of paging is to separating each procedure into pages.
Why paging is used for memory management
Paging is a memory technique that addresses common challenges in allocating and managing memory efficiently. Here we can understand why paging is needed as memory management technique;
ÔÉº	Memory isn‚Äôt always available in a single block; program often need more memory that what is available in breaks memory into smaller , fixed ‚Äìsize pieces,making it easy to allocate scattered free spaces.
ÔÉº	Processes size can increase or decrease; programs do not need to occupy continuous memory so they can grow dynamically without the need to be moved.

When a process is loaded into memory, it is divided into smaller blocks known as pages. These pages  are then mapped to available frames in the physical memory, enabling the operating system to easily  track and managing memory allocation for each process.

Paging allows for the efficient use of memory by storing and retrieving data from various non-contiguous locations within the physical memory.
This helps in reducing fragmentation and improving memory utilization.
Additionally paging enables process to use more memory than what is physically available by swapping pages in and out of secondary storage such as the hard disk.

Overall paging plays a crucial role in optimizing memory management and improving system performance in modern operating systems.
